# HANGMAN
Welcome to my first project and front-end game!

For this project, I decided to create the famous Hangman game! I had a lot of fun making this and despite the styling, I promise I am not a serial killer....

You can play my game by clicking [here](https://manfredjoa.github.io/hangman/). All you have to do to guess a letter is either click the button on the screen, or press the letter on your keyboard. I found the traditional way of playing with 10 lives to be too easy, so I only gave players 6 lives and no hints. Sorry! The only clue I will provide is that all words are coding-related.

Good luck and have fun!
