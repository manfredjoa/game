# HANGMAN
Welcome to my first project and front-end game!

For this [project](https://manfredjoa.github.io/hangman/), I decided to create the famous Hangman game! I had a lot of fun making this and despite the styling, I promise I am not a serial killer....

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this project.

To play Hangman, all you have to do to guess a letter is either click the button on the screen, or press the letter on your keyboard. I found the traditional way of playing with 10 lives to be too easy, so I only gave players 6 lives and no hints. Sorry! The only clue I will provide is that all words are coding-related.

Good luck and have fun!
